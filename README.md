# Otoms by golid

This repository contains the contracts for [Otoms by golid](https://docs.shape.network/building-on-shape/onchain-compatible/otom), as well as the contracts used in the Assembly system.

The Assembly system, built on top of Otoms, is a flexible ERC1155 implementation enabling the creation, crafting, and management of both fungible and non-fungible items on the blockchain. Built with upgradeability in mind, the system allows for component-based crafting where items can be created using blueprints that define required components with specific properties.

Check out the [Assembly docs](https://docs.shape.network/building-on-shape/onchain-compatible/assembly) for more information on creating and crafting items and what.
